Project topic is a good and the problem is well motivated. However, the scope of the project seems too large for in-depth exploration of a set of questions that are answered by the project. 

There should be two parts to the project. First, demonstrates vulnerabilities, which are your first 3 deliverables. The second one focuses on defenses against potential attacks. I would suggest that you either focus on 4 or 5. 

I am also concerned about the viability of the physical lab setting mentioned in the proposal. What would it help you demonstrate beyond what can be done with the simulation? 

Please keep these questions/concerns in mind as you revise the proposal. Also, keep in mind that we prefer more in-depth exploration for a fewer threats/attacks than a broad survey. 

Finally, do discuss the threat model, threat actors and their motivation, any example attacks that may be out there.
