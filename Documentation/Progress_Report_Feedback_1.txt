The proposal still is somewhat at a high level and the specific tasks that will be undertaken is still somewhat unclear. Although reasonable, why zero trust is the right way to go for ARINC is something you want to better argue. Also, what would the rule-based IDS do? What threats will be countered by deploying it? What may not? How will you test/evaluate the simulation model that you develop? I appreciate all the research you are doing related to this topic but I want to get a better sense of the final deliverables and feasibility of getting that done.
