!Rules
# Example formats:
# <alert/log>* <channel>* <label> <SDI> <data> <SSM> <P> <Time> "<message (if alert)>"
# <log>* <channel>* <label>/<bits>* -> logs the decoded data for this channel & label.
# <alert/log>* <channel>* <bit[index1:index2) = "01..10"> "<message (if alert)>"
# <alert/log>* <channel>* <label> <BCD/BNR/DISC> "<message (if alert)>"

# Some information:
# * = required field

# Labels must be in octal format 0oXXX since some of the data is the same for different words!
# E.G. ACMS Information is for both 0o062 and 0o063

# bit[index1:index2) = "10..." option must have indexs be integers in [1,33] (length of a word)
# AND the difference between must match the length of the given string
# E.G. bit[5:10) = "11111" gets bits 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
# bit[20:33) = "1011010010110" gets bits 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32

# <SDI> = human-readable name for that channel.
# E.G. in examples above, Orange: ADIRU -> 11 would be ADIRU and not 11

# SSM must be one of the following options: 00, 01, 10 or 11

# Parity bit <P> is either C for correct or I for incorrect

# Time is an option that prepends the UTC time to the front of the log/alert
# E.G. <UTC Time recording>:"<message (if any)>"
# OR
# <UTC Time recording>:0000...1001 / <UTC Time recording>:<human-readable data point>
# Either the line will have 'time' in it before the message or it will not have it.

# If alerting / logging at the same time, log can only log the bits version and not the human-readable

# Examples (REPLACE THIS SECTION HERE WITH YOUR OWN RULES):
# Alert on if there is a word sent through the Blue channel
alert Blue "Blue bus has a word."
# Alert on any latitude words sent.
alert Blue 0o010 "Latitude word sent"
# Log all the longitudinal data in human-readable format
log Blue 0o011
# Log the word-bits that were sent on the Blue channel
log Blue bits
# Alert and log on this particular word in the Orange Channel
# So logs the full bit-string representation of this word into Logs.txt
# Alerts on 6000 knots for ground speed, with correct parity as message of "Plane's speed is 6000 Knots"
# SSM = 00
alert log 0o012 ADIRU 6000 00 C "Plane's speed is 6000 Knots"
# Alerts on any word containing alternate bits as the data section in the purple bus.
alert Purple bits[11:29) = "0101010101010101" "Funny Pattern!"
# Alerts on any word with that particular label that is BCD as opposed to BNR
# For this label there are 6 different things it could be with 5 encoded as BNR and 1 as BCD
alert Purple 0o062 BCD "Tire Loading (Left Wing Main) Word!"
# Same as above, but just prepends time to the logged alert
alert Purple 0o062 BCD time "Tire Loading (Left Wing Main) Word!"
# etc
